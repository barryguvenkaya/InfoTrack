# InfoTrack Booking API 

## Notes

> This API uses **Swagger** and **Swashbuckle** for development purposes. 
> The reviewer does not require to use a 3rd party tool such as **Postman** etc., simply run the code and **Swagger** interface should appear. 
> Currently there are no unit tests configured due to time constraints on delivering this task. 
> Repository and unit of work pattern has been used for separation of concerns. 
> Validation is done on model's construction level and service layer.
> `main` branch has been locked due to repository being public. Any changes should be done on a `feature` branch and a **PR** should be created.
